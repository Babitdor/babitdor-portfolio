## Projects

### SysML v2 Multi-Agent Workflow Automation
- Fine-tuned multiple LLMs on custom SysML v2 datasets using **Unsloth** and orchestrated multi-agent workflows with **LangChain/LangGraph** for automated code generation, validation, and iterative error correction, with **Docker** containerization for service deployment.
- Implemented **RAG** system using **ChromaDB** to store error correction manuals and approved solutions, enabling context-aware pattern matching and continuous improvement from human feedback.

### Personal Knowledge Assistant
- Built an intelligent knowledge management platform leveraging **RAG architecture**, vector embeddings, and LLMs to enable conversational querying of personal document collections.
- Implemented semantic search pipelines with chunking strategies, embedding generation, and similarity-based retrieval for accurate, context-aware information extraction.

### Codebase QA Assistant
- Developed AI-powered codebase Q&A tool using **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **ChromaDB** to accelerate developer onboarding through RAG-powered natural language search.

### Researcher Assistant
- Developed multi-agent research pipeline using **CrewAI** with custom tools (arXiv retrieval, PubMed search, critic validation) to conduct parallel literature searches, analyze findings, and generate citation-backed research reports.

### Hands-Free Desktop AI Assistant
- Developed real-time voice AI assistant using **Livekit**, locally hosted **Ollama** models (Llama 3, Mistral), and wake-word detection for hands-free activation.
- Integrated **PyAutoGUI** for desktop control, **Gmail API** for email management, and **Spotipy** for music automation.
- Implemented context-aware multi-turn conversation system with modular tool-calling architecture, ensuring full privacy via on-premise deployment.
